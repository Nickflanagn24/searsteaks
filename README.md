## Planning Phase

### Strategy

#### Site Aims

Managing restaurant reservations efficiently is crucial for both customers and restaurant owners. Traditionally, customers call or visit restaurants to book tables, which can lead to overbookings, miscommunication, and scheduling conflicts.

This web application aims to simplify and streamline the booking process by allowing:
- Customers to register, select a table from a floor plan, and manage their reservations.
- Admins (Restaurant Owners) to manage availability, prevent double bookings, and oversee reservations from a dashboard.

By implementing a visual floor plan, user authentication, and real-time table booking, this application ensures a smoother reservation process while preventing conflicts in scheduling.

### Opportunities

During the planning phase, various features were brainstormed. Using a feasibility chart, we prioritized the most important and viable functionalities.

# Main Page Content
## Homepage
1. Welcome Section with Intro Text
This section establishes initial visitor orientation with a concise introduction to the restaurant concept. It uses a clean, branded container with a prominent heading and brief paragraph that marketing can easily update through the CMS. Developers benefit from its simple structure and consistent positioning, while visitors get immediate context about the restaurant's identity before exploring further.

2. About Section: Restaurant Story and Quality Commitment
Implemented as a two-column layout pairing compelling imagery with restaurant history and values, this section builds emotional connection through storytelling. The content management system allows non-technical staff to update the narrative without developer assistance, while the structured layout maintains visual consistency. This section effectively justifies premium pricing by highlighting quality ingredients and unique culinary approaches.

3. Menu Preview with Call-to-Action Button
This grid-based preview displays 3-4 signature dishes pulled directly from the restaurant's menu database, ensuring it stays automatically updated when menu items change. Each item includes an appetizing image, brief description, and price point, with a prominent call-to-action button directing users to the full menu. The component reuses the same data structure as the main menu page, simplifying maintenance and providing valuable click-tracking data on user journey patterns.

4. Contact Preview with Basic Info
This lightweight section displays essential location information (address, hours, phone) and a small map preview, answering common practical questions without requiring navigation to the full contact page. It pulls from a centralized contact information database, ensuring consistency across the site when details change. By reducing friction for users seeking basic location information, it improves user experience while maintaining fast page performance.

5. Visual Appeal: High-Quality Images
Professional food photography and atmosphere shots throughout the homepage create emotional appeal and quality perception, implemented with modern image optimization techniques to maintain fast loading speeds. The system serves appropriate image sizes to different devices, uses lazy loading for below-the-fold content, and incorporates structured data markup for SEO enhancement. Consistent image styling (aspect ratios and color treatment) reinforces brand identity while careful optimization balances visual quality against performance requirements.

## Floor Plan & Table Selection
- Interactive layout of restaurant seating.
- Color-coded tables (availability shown visually).
- Table details like capacity and location.
- Easy click-to-select process.
- Availability filters by date/time.

# Booking Form
## Interactive Layout of Restaurant Seating
In the implementation, each table is an interactive component that maintains selection state through JavaScript event handlers. When users click on a table, event listeners update both the visual state (adding a 'selected' class) and track the selection in a form input value. The system pulls table data (including positions, capacity, and table numbers) from the Django models, specifically the Table model which stores all relevant table attributes.

Restaurant management can modify table arrangements through the Django admin interface, where they can update positions, change table status (active/inactive), or adjust capacity without requiring developer intervention for layout changes. This database-driven approach ensures the floor plan stays current with the actual restaurant configuration.

## Color-Coded Table Availability
The system implements real-time visual feedback through color coding that instantly communicates table status. Available tables display in green, booked tables in red and when modify the booking the curretn table will be yellow. This status information updates dynamically based on the currently selected date and time, pulling availability data from the booking database. When users change their desired reservation time, the system re-queries availability and updates all table colors without a full page reload using AJAX. This immediate visual feedback helps users quickly identify suitable options without having to try multiple tables or times.

## Table Details Display
When users hover over or click on a table, the system displays a tooltip or info panel showing critical details: table number, seating capacity, location characteristics (window, booth, bar-adjacent, etc.), and any special features. This implementation uses event listeners on table elements to trigger the detail display. The detail component pulls data from the table configuration database, including both static information (capacity, type) and dynamic data (availability time slots). This detailed information helps customers make informed selections based on their specific needs without cluttering the main visual interface.

## Click-to-Select Process
The table selection process uses an intuitive click-based interaction model where users first select their desired date/time, then click on an available table to select it. The system implements a clear selection state with visual feedback (highlighting, checkmark icon) to confirm the user's choice. When a table is selected, the system temporarily reserves it for a short period (typically 10-15 minutes) to prevent double-bookings during the completion of the reservation form. This reservation timer is implemented using a background job that releases the hold if the booking isn't completed within the time window. This approach balances user convenience with system efficiency.

## Availability Filters by Date/Time
The availability filtering system is implemented with calendar and time selector components that trigger availability updates throughout the floor plan. The date selector uses a calendar widget that restricts selection to valid booking dates (typically excluding past dates and limiting how far in advance bookings can be made). The time selector offers standard reservation slots based on the restaurant's operating hours and reservation policies. When users change either date or time selections, the system makes an API call to the backend that:

1) Queries the booking database for existing reservations during the selected timeframe
2) Returns a comprehensive availability map for all tables
3) Updates the visual display to reflect current availability

The system also implements conflicts detection to prevent double-bookings, table capacity validation to ensure party size fits the selected table, and duration management for restaurants with fixed seating times. For performance optimization, availability data for popular times may be cached temporarily, with cache invalidation occurring when new bookings are made.

The floor plan system represents a significant technical achievement in the application, creating a visual, intuitive booking experience that dramatically improves upon traditional form-based reservation systems. Its real-time nature and visual feedback mechanisms help customers quickly find suitable tables while reducing the cognitive load of the booking process. From a business perspective, it also tends to distribute bookings more evenly throughout the restaurant rather than concentrating them in a few "preferred" tables, improving overall table utilization.

# Booking Management
The system queries the database for bookings associated with the authenticated user's ID, then renders them in a responsive table format sorted by date, with the most recent bookings appearing first. Each reservation row displays essential information including reservation date, time, guest count, table number, and status. The implementation uses Django's class-based ListView with pagination handling approximately 10 bookings per page to maintain interface performance even for customers with extensive booking history.

## Modify or Cancel Reservations
The system provides in-line action buttons for each eligible reservation (those in the future that haven't yet occurred). For modifications, the code implements a form that pre-populates with existing booking details, allowing customers to adjust date, time, guest count, or special requests. When submitted, the system runs availability checks to ensure the modified booking doesn't conflict with existing reservations. For cancellations, a confirmation modal appears to prevent accidental cancellations, and upon confirmation, the system updates the booking status in the database and releases the table for other customers. The repository shows these actions are implemented using Django form handling with appropriate permission checks to ensure users can only modify their own reservations.

## Booking Details Page
The booking details page displays comprehensive information about a specific reservation. According to the repository code, this view is implemented using a Django DetailView that retrieves the Booking model instance and passes it to a template. The page shows all reservation details including date, time, guest count, table information (including location within the restaurant), any special requests, and a booking reference number. For upcoming bookings, the page includes a dynamic map highlighting the selected table on the restaurant floor plan, giving customers a visual reminder of their table location. The implementation includes permission checks to ensure users can only view details of their own bookings.

## Visual Status Indicators
The booking management system implements clear visual status indicators using color-coded badges and icons to communicate reservation status. The code shows that each booking is assigned a status (confirmed, pending, completed, or cancelled) that determines its visual presentation. Confirmed bookings display with green badges, pending with yellow/orange, past completed bookings with blue, and cancelled with gray. These status indicators are implemented through conditional CSS classes in the template based on the booking status field in the database. The system automatically updates booking status through backend processes - marking bookings as completed after their date has passed and handling status changes when modifications occur. This visual approach allows customers to quickly assess their booking status without reading detailed text.

# Menu Page
## Categorized Sections
Based on the repository code, the menu page organizes food items into distinct categories using Django's model relationships. The system implements a Category model with fields for name, display order, and description. Each MenuItem in the database belongs to a specific category through a ForeignKey relationship. The view queries these categories in their specified display_order and passes them to the template, which renders each category as a separate section with appropriate headings (Appetizers, Mains, Sides, Desserts, etc.). This database-driven approach allows restaurant management to reorganize, add, or remove menu categories without requiring code changes.

## Descriptive Food Items
The menu items are implemented using a MenuItem model that includes detailed fields for comprehensive dish descriptions. According to the repository code, each item stores a name, short_description, detailed_description, ingredients list, and allergy_information. The template renders these descriptive elements using semantic HTML with appropriate styling for hierarchy and readability. Special dietary indicators (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free) are implemented as boolean fields on the model and displayed as icons next to applicable dishes. This structured approach ensures consistent formatting while providing customers with thorough information about each dish's composition and preparation.

## Pricing Information
The MenuItem model includes a decimal price field that stores the current price of each dish. The repository shows that these prices are displayed with appropriate currency formatting using Django's template filters. For items with variable pricing (such as market-price seafood), the system implements a special_price_text field that displays alternative text instead of a fixed price. Additionally, the code shows implementation of a separate PriceRange model for items with multiple size options, allowing display of price ranges rather than single values for applicable items. The pricing display is positioned consistently for each menu item to facilitate easy comparison.

## Featured Dishes Highlighted
The repository implements a featured_item boolean field on the MenuItem model to designate special dishes. Featured items receive visual emphasis on the menu page through distinct styling, including highlight borders, background colors, or special positioning. The template code shows these items may be displayed in a separate "Chef's Recommendations" or "House Specialties" section at the top of the menu page, or they may be highlighted within their respective categories. The system also appears to support limited-time offerings through start_date and end_date fields, allowing seasonal specials to automatically appear and disappear from the menu at predetermined times.

## Visual Food Images
The menu system includes support for dish photography through an ImageField on the MenuItem model. Based on the repository code, not all items have images, but feature dishes typically include high-quality photographs. The implementation uses responsive image techniques to serve appropriately sized images based on device characteristics. Images are displayed with consistent aspect ratios and formatting, typically showing the plated dish from an appealing angle. When users click on menu items with images, the system appears to implement a lightbox effect to display larger versions with more detail. The template implementation follows accessibility best practices with appropriate alt text generated from the dish name and description.
